# PDB Statistics

The PDB is the main database for structural information on biomolecules let's see what it contains:

```{r}
db <- read.csv("Data Export Summary.csv")
db
```

> Q1. What percentage of structures in the PDB are solved by X-Ray and Electron Microscopy.

```{r}
db$X.ray
```

Remove the commas!

```{r}
db$X.ray <- gsub(",", "", db$X.ray)
```

```{r}
write.csv(db)
```

```{r}
xray.total<- sum(as.numeric(gsub(",","", db$X.ray)))
```

```{r}
db$EM <- gsub(",", "", db$EM)
```

```{r}
em.total <-sum(as.numeric(gsub(",","", db$EM)))
```

Now we have to write a function:

```{r}
# I will work with `x` as input 

sum_comma <- function(x) {
  # Substitute the comma and convert to numeric 
  sum(as.numeric(gsub(",","",x)))
}

```

```{r}
sum_comma(db$X.ray)
```

```{r}
sum_comma(db$Total)
```

For X.ray

```{r}
sum_comma(db$X.ray) / sum_comma(db$Total)
```

For EM:

```{r}
sum_comma(db$EM)
```

```{r}
sum_comma(db$EM) / sum_comma(db$Total)
```

> Q2. What proportion of structures in the PDB are protein?

```{r}
round (sum_comma(db$Total[1]) / sum_comma(db$Total),2)
```

> Q3: Type HIV in the PDB website search box on the home page and determine how many HIV-1 protease structures are in the current PDB?

skipped!

# Visualizing the HIV-1 protease structure

> Q4. Water molecules normally have 3 atoms. Why do we see just one atom per water molecule in this structure?

We are not able to see the hydrogen atoms because it is too small for it to be visualized in the technology that we have today, since it is smaller than 2 angstroms

> Q5. There is a critical "conserved" water molecule in the binding site. Can you identify this water molecule? What residue number does this water molecule have

HOH308

# Working with Structure in R 

We can use the `bio3d` package to read and perform bioinformatics calculations on PDB structures. 

```{r}
library(bio3d)

pdb <- read.pdb("1hsg")
pdb
```


```{r}
attributes(pdb)
```

```{r}
head (pdb$atom)
```

Read an ADK structure 

```{r}
adk <- read.pdb("6s36")
adk
```

Perform a prediction of flexibility with a technique called NMA (Normal Mode Analysis)

```{r}
# perform flexibility prediction 
m<- nma(adk)
m
plot(m)
```
Write out a "movie" (aka trajectory) of the motion for viewing in MOLstar 

```{r}
mktrj(m, file= "adk_m7.pdb")
```

The created file can be read in MOLstar

>Q7.  How many amino acid residues are there in this pdb object? 
  
  198

>Q8. Name one of the two non-protein residues?

HOH

>Q9. How many protein chains are in this structure? 

2
